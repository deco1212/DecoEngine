# Friday Night Funkin' - Deco Engine
A modified version of Psych Engine, targetting towards cleaning it and making the gameplay more modern looking, also making it more beginner friendly.

## Installation:
You must have [the most up-to-date version of Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/) (So that means you have to upgrade it)

open up a Command Prompt/PowerShell or Terminal, type `haxelib install hmm`

after it finishes, simply type `haxelib run hmm install` in order to install all the needed libraries for *Psych Engine!*
